## Performance Anti-patterns
2m 13s

- Performance Anti-patterns
  - Cause availability, scalability, and capacity problems under pressure
  - Difficult to identify during testing 
  - Identify the minimum performance threshold
- Eight anti-patterns
  - Busy database
  - Busy front end
  - Chatty I/O
  - Extraneous fetching
    - Retrieving data more than needed
  - Improper instantiation
    - Keeps instantiating and disposing sharable objects
  - Monolithic persistence
  - No caching
  - Synchronous I/O

## Busy Database, Busy Front End, Chatty I/O, and Extraneous Fetching
2m 58s

- Busy database
  - Database is processing too much data
  - Bottleneck during high usage
  - Increased runtime costs
  - To identify it:
    - Monitor performance and examine database operations
  - Potential solution:
    - Move the tasks to an compute resource which is easily scalable. 
- Busy Front End
  - Increased response times by doing resource-intensive tasks or I/O
  - Potential solution:
    - Offloading too many resource-intensive tasks to background threads
    - Move processes to a separate backend
    - Use a message queue for asynchronous processing
- Chatty I/O
  - Impacts performance and responsiveness
  - To identify it:
    - Reading and writing distinct requests
  - Solution:
    - Combine queries, follow REST design principles and write once
    - Combine many smaller query into one
    - Buffer the data and then write it at the end
- Improper Instantiation
  - Applies only to thread-safe classes
  - Hurts performance and could result in unnecessary exceptions
  - Drop in throughput, increased memory use and network activity
  - Solution:
    - Shared singleton instance of the class
- Extraneous Fetching
  - Retrieve all data to minimize I/O requests
  - Overcompensate for the Chatty I/O antipattern
  - Causes high latency and low throughput
  - Avoid fetching large volumes of data by filtering
- Monolithic Persistence
  - Putting all data into a single data store can hurt performance
  - Storing and retrieving unrelated data can cause slow response times
  - Unoptimized data for the application
  - Identify:
    - Dramatic slowdown with eventual failure
  - Solution:
    - Separate data according to usage
- No Caching
  - Repeatedly fetching the same data reduces performance and scalability
  - Expensive to access data
  - Solution:
    - On-demand or cache-aside strategies
      - Read and retrieve cache
      - Write and remove cache
- Synchronous I/O
  - Locks the calling the thread while the thread completes
  - Reduces performance and affects vertical scalability
  - Wastes processing resources
  - Solution:
    - Synchronous to asynchronous operations
    - Use asynchronous operations where possible

## Design Patterns for Autoscaling
1m 58s

- Autoscaling
  - Dynamically allocating resources to match performance requirements
  - Reduces the need for an operator to continually monitor the performance of a system  
  - Not an instant solution
- Throttling Pattern
  - Control the consumption of resources used by an instance of an application 
  - Prevents a system from being overwhelmed while scaling out automatically
- Competing Consumers Pattern
  - Multiple concurrent consumers processing messages on the same channel
  - Processes multiple messages concurrently to improve scalability and availability

## Microsoft Azure Compute Autoscaling

# Identifying Extensibility Requirements
5m 1s
- Design principle focusing on future growth
- Difficult to identify due to lack of knowledge about future features
- Design patterns help with modification

## Extensibility Design Patterns
0m 46s
- Extensible Design Patterns
  - Changes can be made to existing functionality with minimum impact
  - Select proper patterns during application design
  - Three patterns that support extensibility:
    - Decorator
      - Attach responsibilities to an object at runtime
      - More flexible than class inheritance
      - Easily allows future addition of different behaviours
      - Compose complex objects from smaller simple objects
    - Visitor
      - Define new operations without changing the classes of the elements on which it operates
      - Encourages extensibility by simplifying addition of new operations
      - Groups related behaviours
    - Iterator
      - Access elements of an aggregate object without exposing underlying representation 
      - Create new iterator class without touching collection code
      - Used with visitor design pattern to traverse complex data structures
