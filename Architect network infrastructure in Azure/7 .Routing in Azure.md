## [Manage and control traffic flow in your Azure deployment with routes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/index)
- [Introduction](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/1-introduction)
- [Identify routing capabilities of an Azure virtual network](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/2-azure-virtual-network-route)
  - Azure routing
    - Network traffic in Azure is automatically routed across Azure subnets, virtual networks, and on-premises networks. 
    - This routing is controlled by system routes, which are assigned by default to each subnet in a virtual network.
  - You can't create or delete system routes. But you can override the system routes by adding custom routes to control traffic flow to the next hop.
  - Every subnet has the following default system routes:
    |Address prefix	|Next hop type|
    |---|---|
    |Unique to the virtual network	|Virtual network|
    |0.0.0.0/0	|Internet|
    |10.0.0.0/8	|None|
    |172.16.0.0/12	|None|
    |192.168.0.0/16	|None|
    |100.64.0.0/10	|None|
      - The **Next hop type** column shows the network path taken by traffic sent to each address prefix
        - **Virtual network**: 
          - With in the Vnet
          - A route is created in the address prefix. The prefix represents each address range created at the virtual-network level. If multiple address ranges are specified, multiple routes are created for each address range.
        - **Internet**: 
          - Any other route
          - The default system route 0.0.0.0/0 routes any address range to the internet, unless you override Azure's default route with a custom route.
        - **None**: 
          - Any traffic routed to this hop type is dropped and doesn't get routed outside the subnet. 
          - By default, the following IPv4 private-address prefixes are created: 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16. The prefix 100.64.0.0/10 for a shared address space is also added. **None of these address ranges are globally routable.**
  - Within Azure, there are additional system routes. Azure will create these routes if the following capabilities are enabled:
    - Virtual network peering
    - Service chaining
      - Virtual network peering and service chaining let virtual networks within Azure be connected to one another. 
      - This communication in turn creates additional routes within the default route table. 
      - Service chaining lets you override these routes by creating user-defined routes between peered networks.
    - Virtual network gateway
      - Use a virtual network gateway to send encrypted traffic between Azure and on-premises over the internet and to send encrypted traffic between Azure networks. A virtual network gateway contains routing tables and gateway services.
    - Virtual network service endpoint
      - Your Azure virtual machines can access your storage account directly from the private address space and deny access from a public virtual machine. As you enable service endpoints, Azure creates routes in the route table to direct this traffic.
  - Custom routes
    - **User-defined routes**
      - You use a user-defined route to override the default system routes so that traffic can be routed through firewalls or NVAs.
      - For example, you might have a network with two subnets and want to add a virtual machine in the perimeter network to be used as a firewall. You create a user-defined route so that traffic passes through the firewall and doesn't go directly between the subnets.
      - With user-defined routes, you can't specify the next hop type **VirtualNetworkServiceEndpoint**, which indicates virtual network peering.
      - When creating user-defined routes, you can specify these next hop types:
        - **Virtual appliance**: A virtual appliance is typically a firewall device used to analyze or filter traffic that is entering or leaving your network. You can specify the private IP address of a NIC attached to a virtual machine so that IP forwarding can be enabled. Or you can provide the private IP address of an internal load balancer.
        - **Virtual network gateway**: Use to indicate when you want routes for a specific address to be routed to a virtual network gateway. The virtual network gateway is specified as a VPN for the next hop type.
        - **Virtual network**: Use to override the default system route within a virtual network.
        - **Internet**: Use to route traffic to a specified address prefix that is routed to the internet.
        - **None**: Use to drop traffic sent to a specified address prefix.
    - **Border gateway protocol**
      - A network gateway in your on-premises network can exchange routes with a virtual network gateway in Azure by using BGP. BGP is the standard routing protocol that is normally used to exchange routing and information among two or more networks.
      - BGP offers **network stability** because routers can quickly change connections to send packets if a connection path goes down.
      - You typically use BGP to 
        - advertise on-premises routes to Azure when you're connected to an Azure datacenter through Azure **ExpressRoute**. 
        - configure BGP if you connect to an Azure virtual network by using a **VPN site-to-site connection**.
  - Route selection and priority
    - If multiple routes are available in a route table, Azure uses the route with the **longest prefix match** because it's more **specific**.
      - 10.0.0.0/16 and 10.0.0.0/24 prefixes, Azure selects the route with the 10.0.0.0/24 prefix
    - can't configure multiple user-defined routes with the same address prefix.
    - If multiple routes share the same address prefix, Azure selects the route based on its type in the following order of priority:
      - User-defined routes
      - BGP routes
      - System routes

- [Exercise - Create custom routes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-au/learn/modules/control-network-traffic-flow-with-routes/3-exercise-create-custom-routes)
  - Exercise: You'll want to ensure communication between front-end public servers and internal private servers is always routed through the appliance.
    - You'll configure the network so that all traffic flowing from a public subnet to a private subnet will be routed through the NVA. To make this flow happen, you'll create a custom route for the public subnet to route this traffic to a perimeter-network subnet. Later, you'll deploy an NVA to the perimeter-network subnet.

  - Create a route table and custom route
    - create a route table
      ```
      az network route-table create \
      --name publictable
      --resource-group <>
      --disable-bgp-route-propagation false
      ```
    - create a custom route in the route-table
      ```
        az network route-table route create \
            --route-table-name publictable \
            --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
            --name productionsubnet \
            --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 \
            --next-hop-type VirtualAppliance \
            --next-hop-ip-address 10.0.2.4
      ```
    - Create a virtual network and subnets
    - Associate the route table with the public subnet
      ```
      az network vnet subnet update \
        --name publicsubnet \
        --vnet-name vnet \
        --resource-group [sandbox resource group name] \
        --route-table publictable
      ```
